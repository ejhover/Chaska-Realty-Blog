Real estate evolves constantly—and so do I. Since 1985, I've solved complex property challenges, but my focus is what works NOW: AI-enhanced analysis, data-driven pricing, and technology delivering results clients can't achieve alone.
I specialize in Chaska, Chanhassen, Victoria, and Carver County across three areas:
TRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL SALES Helping families buy and sell with deep local knowledge from hundreds of annual transactions. I know which Chaska neighborhoods appreciate, which streets command premiums, and how to maximize value.
DISTRESSED PROPERTY SOLUTIONS Working with homeowners facing hardship, lenders managing REO portfolios, and investors. Clients include Fannie Mae, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, regional banks and Savings in Loans, national private equity firms and hedge funds.
NEW CONSTRUCTION & LAND LIQUIDATIONS Partnering with builders from single-lot sales to large-scale liquidations, with expertise in Carver County's Highway 212 corridor.
WHY LOCAL EXPERTISE MATTERS Chaska's $452,000 median tells you nothing about the $900,000+ variation between Historic Downtown and Lake Bavaria estates as well as everything in between. Generic metro agents miss these distinctions. I don't.
Four decades tracking every development, infrastructure change, and market cycle means I know not just what's happening and who is making it happen-but why it matters to your transaction.
ALWAYS LEARNING- The 1985 industry barely resembles today's tech-driven marketplace. I've embraced AI-powered CMAs, predictive analytics, digital marketing, virtual staging, 3D tours, and blockchain transactions.
"How we've always done it" leads to irrelevance. I invest in education and technology—because todays clients deserve today's solutions.

WHAT MATTERS MOST Coaching distressed homeowners to viability, protecting neighborhood values, connecting first-time buyers with opportunities. Every deal impacts real lives—that drives continuous improvement.
Whether buying your first Chaska home, selling Carver County property, managing distressed assets, or exploring investments, I bring local expertise and current market knowledge.
